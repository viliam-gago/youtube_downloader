# YouTube downloader 

This app allows downloading YouTube content and extracting only audio if wanted.
It's main benefits are simplicity and absence of any ads. App has very straightforward GUI, therefore it is easy to use - just paste the URL
of desired YouTube content and press download button according to desired format. This little project also provided an enjoyable chance to refresh
my knowledge of PyQt5 module.

Options:

- .mp3 file (audio only)
- .mp4 file

- You can also download whole playlist (either .mp3 / .mp4; ). In that case, copy URL containing whole YouTube playlist. This will download
all items from playlist as multiple files.
